My sister,5 Paula, and her husband, Chris, had just finished tucking their 
young ones into bed one evening when they heard crying coming from the children's room. 
Rushing in, they found Tommy 6  crying hysterically.

He had accidentally swallowed a pence coin and was sure he was going to die. 
No amount of talking could change his mind. Trying to calm him, 
Chris palmed a pence coin that he happened to have in  his pocket 
and 7 pretended to remove it 7 from Tommy's ear.  Tommy, naturally,
 was delighted. In a  flash, he snatched it from his father's 9 hand, 
swallowed it and demanded cheerfully - 'Do it again, Dad!'
