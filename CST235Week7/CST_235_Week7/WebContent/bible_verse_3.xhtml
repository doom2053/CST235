		Bible verse 3: 
		<br></br>
		II Corinthians 12:9-11 (NIV)
		<br></br>
		"But he said to me, my grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." 
		Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may 
		rest on me. That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in 
		hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
